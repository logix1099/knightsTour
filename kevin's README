didn't get the time to figure out the knight tour program to completion. however i got it back to a running state so it can be seen when i made it to.
where i made it to
1)it correctly figures out the inital number of move each postion has
2)the knight move from one place to another as a proper knights move
3) it decreases the number of moves as the knight moves

problems
1)it travels back to visited squares

not done stuff
1)no tie breaking implemented.
